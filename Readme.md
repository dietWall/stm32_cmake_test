#Overview of the Project

This is a project for Software Quality Assurance Lecture
The Goal is to setup a Build Pipeline for a MCU Project.

Tools: 
- Gitlab
    - builds the project, Artifacts are used for deployment
- Docker 
    - Provides an environment for repeatable builds, on a local desktop PC and inside Cloud (Gitlab deployment) as well

##Project Structure
This Folder is generated by STM32 CubeMX and follows the structure from this IDE
- EWARM
contains Project files and startup files for IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM and the IAR Compiler
- MDK-ARM
contains Project files and startup files for KEIL MDK Microcontroller Development Kit
- SW4STM32
contains Project files and startup files for System Workbench from STM32. As SW4STM32 uses GCC for compilation - this files are reused for our setup. Unfortunately as of time of writing, there are no example projects for the newer STM32CubeIDE.
- Drivers
contains generic (somewhat compiler independent) drivers for STM32MCU, like the Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS). Also the STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
- Inc
User Include Files for the Application
- SRC 
User Source Files for the Application

Additional Libraries/Source Files should go into a dedicated Libs/ folder

##Building Process
